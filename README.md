# Above Jersey: Skies

This project aims to use common sense to identify what is happening in the skies above [our island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey).
We will bring visibility to the state of the skies above Jersey and the direct impact weather modification (geo-engineering) is having on daily life.

## Contributing

We are a small collective of locals that are becoming increasingly frustrated with the lack of transparency, clarity and honesty coming from the Government of Jersey with regard to our skies.

This repository houses first-hand evidence of the impact of geo-engineering on our skies and aims to provide verifiable proof that geo-engineering **is being conducted above Jersey** and the negative impacts it is having. We also include many resources published by experts and researchers from around the world. In addition, we have also included a wide range of Government issued documentation and scientific studies in the hope that someone will actually read this information, take responsibility and finally share the truth with the masses about geo-engineering.

We are crowdsourcing images, videos and associated data on a daily basis. Information consists of:

1. Images of the sky throughout the day
2. Videos of planes flying overhead that appear dispersing material into the atmosphere
3. Satellite, weather and shipping reports on a daily basis direct from Gov.je
4. Anecdotal information relating to the state of the sky in open format (.csv)
5. Flight reports from FlightAware.com that identify planes overhead and correlate this information with imagery/videos

## Cloud Formation and Geo-Engineering

Geo-Engineering refers to the intentional modification of cloud properties to influence the Earth’s climate. This is being achieved through various methods, including:

1. Cloud Seeding: Introducing substances like silver iodide or dry ice into clouds to enhance precipitation and alter cloud properties;
2. Marine Cloud Brightening: Spraying seawater into the air to increase the reflectivity of marine clouds, which can help cool the planet;
3. Solar Geoengineering: Injecting particles into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight and reduce the amount of solar radiation that reaches the Earth's surface;
4. Cloud Formation Modification: Altering the conditions that lead to cloud formation, such as temperature, humidity, and aerosol concentrations, to influence cloud properties.

According to the proponents of these techniques, the goals are to:

a. Cool the planet: By increasing the reflectivity of clouds, reducing the amount of solar radiation absorbed, or enhancing precipitation to remove excess heat from the atmosphere;
b. Mitigate climate change: By reducing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere or slowing down global warming;
c. Improve weather patterns: By altering cloud properties to influence precipitation patterns, reduce extreme weather events, or enhance agricultural productivity.

However, cloud formation geoengineering raises serious concerns about:

- Unintended consequences: Altering cloud properties could have unforeseen effects on global climate patterns, weather patterns, and ecosystems;
- Ethical considerations: Geoengineering could be seen as tampering with the natural environment and potentially disrupting the balance of the Earth’s climate system;
- Technical challenges: Developing and implementing effective geoengineering techniques is a complex task, requiring significant scientific understanding and technological advancements.

Numerous scientists, individuals and groups have highlighted the potential challenges of geoengineering, including:

- Weather modification techniques, such as cloud seeding, have been used to enhance precipitation and mitigate droughts;
- Solar geoengineering, while promising, is still a highly speculative and controversial approach that requires further research and development.

Geo-Engineering is a complex and multifaceted field that requires careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks.

## Background

There is no climate emergency. The term `climate emergency` is simply used by Governments and the so-called elites to trick people (`spelling`) into thinking that `man made climate change` is occurring. However, when you look back at historical archaelogical records, raw data and open your own eyes, it is plain to see there are cycles of `warming` and `cooling` that happen on planet earth. We will be adding as much information as possible on these phenomenon to enable readers and researchers to conduct their own analysis.

There are several `pan-government agreements` that give rise to the `climate narrative` push. For reference, the main policies being used to `cast spells` over the population are:
