> Project Goal: To bring visibility to the state of the skies above Jersey and the direct impact weather modification (geo-engineering) is having on our island.

We are a small collective of locals that are becoming increasingly frustrated with the lack of transparency, clarity and honesty coming from the Government of Jersey with regard to our skies.

This repository houses first-hand evidence of the impact of geo-engineering on our skies and aims to provide verifiable proof that geo-engineering **is being conducted above Jersey** and the negative impacts it is having. We also include many resources published by experts and researchers from around the world. In addition, we have also included a wide range of Government issued documentation and scientific studies in the hope that someone will actually read the information and finally tell the truth about geo-engineering to the masses.

## Background

There is no climate emergency. The term `climate emergency` is simply a term used by Government departments to trick people into believing that `man made climate change` is occurring. However, when you look back at the historical archaelogical records, it is plain to see there are cycles of `warming` and `cooling`. We will be adding as much information as possible on these phenomenon to enable readers and researchers to conduct their own analysis.

There are several `pan-government agreements` that give rise to the `climate narrative` push, however the primary one is the [Paris Climate Agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement).
