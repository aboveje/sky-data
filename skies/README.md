# Above Jersey: Skies

This project aims to use common sense to identify what is happening in the skies above [our island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey).

## Contributing

We are crowdsourcing images, videos and associated data on a daily basis. Information consists of:

1. Images of the sky throughout the day
2. Videos of planes flying overhead that appear dispersing material into the atmosphere
3. Satellite, weather and shipping reports on a daily basis direct from Gov.je
4. Anecdotal information relating to the state of the sky in open format (.csv)
5. Flight reports from FlightAware.com that identify planes overhead and correlate this information with imagery/videos

If you wish to contribute, create a Github account, open an issue and submit a pull request. We welcome contributions from everyone.
