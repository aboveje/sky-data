# How To: Source Met Office Data

We are collecting the following data points from the Jersey Met Office:

1. Daily Satellite Imagery
2. Daily Wind & Wave data
3. Daily Shipping Forecast

Please ensure they are clear screenshots or downloaded satellite imagery. Label the filenames 
like `2024-06-04-0000UTC-jerseymet-windwaves.png` where the date, time and timezone start the 
filename, then `jerseymet` indicates the source and `windwaves` indicates the type of image 
represented. Ensure you separate with hyphens.
